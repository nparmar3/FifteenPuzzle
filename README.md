# FifteenPuzzle

This repository is dedicated to a fifteen puzzle game that my team and I created that is spongebob themed. 
The goal of the puzzle is to un-jumble its fifteen squares by repeatedly making moves that slide squares into the empty space.
We created a dropdown menu with three other pictures and a gif to use for the puzzle. We've added a timer as well as a play again link.
There's also music if you turn up the volume :)

The puzzle was created strictly using HTML, CSS and JS.
